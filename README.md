# Earthquake_Pipeline_Collision_Avoidance

Problem- Bursting of Gas and other explosive pipelines during earthquakes.

Solution using GPS modules and Collision Sensors to accurately pinpoint the location so as to raise alarms and switch off that areas during and after earthquake.

Method.
1. During the laying of pipelines, install gps modules with the pipeline which will determine its location and warn incase of any movement with the help of collision sensors.
2. If an earthquake occurs, the collision sensors give output which activates the gps module and using Internet of Things sends the locations to agencies to pin point the loation.
